# Mufi Lang

Mufi-Lang is an experimental dynamic programming language built for research purposes, with a strong focus in the domain of mathematics. 
The goal is to be able to develop algorithms, that could be built to optimally handle mathematic problems with the use of Computer Science techniques.
The language's compiler is currently built in Zig, which brings the name MufiZ, we hope to build more tools related to the project, and we 
have a strong focus on trying to support many toolchains. 

This project is developed by Mustafif Khan and under the MoKa Reads Foundation.
